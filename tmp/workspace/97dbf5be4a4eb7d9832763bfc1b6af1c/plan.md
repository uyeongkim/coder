To solve this problem, we need to understand that we need to count the number of beautiful partitions of a number `n` such that each string of length `l` contains no leading zeros. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to partition `n` into non-negative integer values `a_i` and `l_i`, where `1 <= a_i <= n` and `0 <= l_i < max(l, n)`.

We can approach this using dynamic programming. The idea is to use DP arrays to store the number of ways to partition `n` into non-negative integer values with `l_i` ranging from 0 to `max(l, n)`. Here's how you can implement this:

1. **Initialize**:
   - Create a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the number of ways to partition `i` into `j
